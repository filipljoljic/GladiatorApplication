# GladiatorApplication

Gladiator is an application that will be available to every user that wants to stay in good form or just wants to begin working out. On this application it will be possible to book an appointment with some personal trainers that will be available on our application. Users are also going to find many videos with exercises for specific body parts. Every video will have a short description how to properly do that exercise and number of repetitions that is best for users age, height and weight. Application Gladiator will also have a personal section where every user will be able to insert some information about them and about their workouts for example how many days in a week have they exercise, how many calories did they burned and so on. Gladiator application will also work in coordination with gyms and fitness centers so a user can reserve a personal trainer from a specific gym or book a group training. On this application user can find gyms and fitness centers on maps so they donâ€™t have problems with finding us.

*Thing that we will try to implement is a section where user will add all meals he/she had that day and the program will calculate their calories that they have eaten.
